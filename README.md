As a third year college student, the pressure of finding and securing an internship grows more and more. For this reason, I've sent out dozens of applications, and have grown to resent the process of creating a new account for each individual applciation that I decide to send out.
As I think back to when I was a high school student applying to go to college, the ease-of-use and aa-in-one aspect of CommonApp was a very attractive idea to me. For this reason, I promised to myself that I would create a tool that would relieve the struggles of college students such
as myself.
